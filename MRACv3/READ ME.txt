Hello, my name is Juan Santos. I wrote this library, so you can use it to apply Adaptive Control by Reference Model (MRAC).
This library is part of my TCC in Eng. of Control and Automation at the IFRO Campus Calama in 2022.
I did this with the help of my advisors Jos√© Diogo and Kariston Dias, not to mention the help of dozens of strangers on the internet who wrote articles, books, questions on internet forums and everything else that a graduate student who had just the concept of adaptive control and now could understand a little to make this library.
I'm doing this because it would have helped me a lot in my course, during I don't remember which subject, but some in the control area, continuing with the subject of advanced control and getting into adaptive control. But that is already a subject for another story.

Let's get down to what really matters. In that folder you will find:
  - The 'examples' folder: In this folder you have the Arduino codes that I hope will help you to better understand how to use each function of this library;
  - The 'keywords' file: Nothing more than a text file for the Arduino IDE to color the functions differently when you are using them;
  - The 'MRAC.h' and 'MRAC.cpp' files: These two files work together, it's literally where the library works. Don't modify anything unless you're very sure of what you're doing, even so, just in case, make a backup before your changes.
